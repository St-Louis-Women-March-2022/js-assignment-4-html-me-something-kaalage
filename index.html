                  Planning a trip to Europe for two weeks and need an itinerary? Don't worry, I got your back! Fourteen
                  days may sound like a long vacation, but with so many countries in the continent, attractions, sights
                  to see and cultures to experience in Europe, a two weeks vacation will go by in the blink of an eye, 
                  so planning is key! Our journey starts on October 15th and goes until October 28th.

            <h3>Days 1-2: Lisbon</h3>
            <p>
               Day one begins in Figueira Square. From here, we take the train to the São Jorge Castle, where we can
               get some of the most beautiful views of Lisbon and the Tagus River. After visiting the castle and having
               lunch at one of Alfama's genuine restaurants, we will take a bus to Parque das Nações, visit the Oceanário
               de Lisboa and enjoy the view of the impressive Vasco da Gama Bridge, the largest overpass in Europe.

               On day two we will head to Belém, the most fabulous parish in Lisbon, as it houses two of the city’s most
               impressive landmarks: the Jerónimos Monastery and Belém Tower. There we will also find the 25 April Bridge,
               the Monument to the Discoveries and the National Coach Museum in Belém, not to mention its renowned pastéis de Belém.

            <h3>Days 3-4: Algarve</h3>
            <p>
               Our next stop is the Algarve: the jewel of Portugal, boasting a breathtaking coastline, epic caves and archways.
               During six years I was fortunate to live there and I'll be finally back after 10 years! Loulé will be the first
               city to visit family members and also some friends from school. There we will visit the castle, the Vilamoura Marina 
               and the market hall. Day four will be reserved to meet beautiful beaches like Marinha Beach, Benagil Caves and Albufeira.

            <h3>Days 5-8: Paris</h3>
            <p>
               On our first day in Paris we will visit the Eiffel Tower, walk through Parc du Champ, visit the Arc de Triomphe and Les Invalides.
               Lastly, we will treat ourselves with a nice french dinner on our first night in Paris! Second day starts off by exploring
               Paris' Latin Quarter, where you can find the Panthéon. After that, is time to finally meet Montmartre and see the locations
               where my favorite movie was filmed (Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain). In the afternoon and evening we will visit the Louvre
               since is open on Fridays until 9:45pm and will be far more pleasant without the crowds.

            <p>
               The next attraction on day three will be the Île de la Cité, the island where Paris was founded and to this day
               remains the heart of the city. Bright and early we will head to Notre-Dame Cathedral, but unfortnately just admire
               from the outside. Next, we will walk over Sainte-Chapelle and the Conciergerie. The rest of the day will be to rest and enjoy a good meal.

            </p>

            <p>
               In our last day in France we will take a trip to the Palace of Versailles. This decadent palace was home to French royalty who lived so lavishly it started a revolution!
